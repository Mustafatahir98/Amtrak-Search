# Amtrak Search
 The files handle bus and Amtrak station searches based on proximity to specified cities. Using the Google Geocoding API, they retrieve station details, filter stations within a set distance from the user's city, and display results in a table. Key functions include city-based filtering and distance calculations between locations for user convenience.
